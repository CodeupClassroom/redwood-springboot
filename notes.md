# Extra practice

#### Nov 3rd

Create some pages to show cars.

- Add a car Model with the following private properties: id, make, model, year, color, miles.
- Add 2 pages that displays a list of cars `index.html`, an individual car `show.html`. Use fragments to display a navbar, sidebar with some filters as a html form, footer and header.
- Add a Controller that handles the urls: `/cars` and `car/id`.

You can create a new branch for this practice exercise so you don't affect anything in the blog application.

## Add features to your blog

This are a couple of things you can include in your blog:

- Add images to a post, this requires another table related to the post tables.
- Add custom error pages.
- Add some ways to get JSON objects from the list of posts.
- Make sure only the owner of the post can edit, delete a post.
- Add a profile page and be able to edit some details about the user like password, email.
- Add tags to the posts.
- Add created_at, edited_at columns with date times for the posts and update them automatically.
- Make it pretty!
