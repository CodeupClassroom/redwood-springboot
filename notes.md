# Extra practice

#### Nov 3rd

Create some pages to show cars.

- Add a car Model with the following private properties: id, make, model, year, color, miles.
- Add 2 pages that displays a list of cars `index.html`, an individual car `show.html`. Use fragments to display a navbar, sidebar with some filters as a html form, footer and header.
- Add a Controller that handles the urls: `/cars` and `car/id`.

You can create a new branch for this practice exercise so you don't affect anything in the blog application.
